I'm an iOS engineer and technical mentor who has been working on apps in Objective-C and Swift since early 2011. In 2019, I founded my own company, Hiddink Development LLC, with the intent to focus development efforts on native iOS app projects in Swift while helping other aspiring developers through paired programming and one-on-one coaching. To learn more about what's going on at Hiddink Development or to just show your support, feel free to [follow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hiddinkdev) the company's page on LinkedIn.
